# Contributing guidelines

Make sure to follow these guidelines before opening an [issue](https://github.com/Bellisario/musicale/issues/new/choose) or a [pull request](https://github.com/Bellisario/musicale/pulls):

- An issue is for a bug or a feature request, if you have any question or something similar, please use [Discussions](https://github.com/Bellisario/musicale/discussions).
- Before opening an issue of a pull request, please check if the issue or the pull request already exists.
- Before opening a pull request, make sure to run Svelte formatter (included with Svelte VSCode plugin) and `npm run check` on the whole project to keep code style and linting rules.
- Pull requests for packages updates are not allowed because Dependabot checks them automatically.
- If you don't know how to contribute, also because you don't know Svelte, TypeScript, JavaScript, etc. you can always help others on [Discussions](https://github.com/Bellisario/musicale/discussions), debug the application, share your awesome ideas with a new issue (feature request) and check the whole project for misspellings, too.
